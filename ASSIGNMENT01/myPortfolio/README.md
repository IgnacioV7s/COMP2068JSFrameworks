# My Computer Programmer Portfolio (Ignacio Valenzuela - 200555779)

This is my personal portfolio, developed using **Express** and **Node.js**. This portfolio showcases information about myself and the projects I have worked on. Since I don't have professional programming experience yet, I included some personal projects I created for practice as well as projects I developed during my Co-Op internship.

I also added a contact section where visitors can reach out to me through a form that uses **EmailJS**.

## Project Structure

The project consists of 4 different views, each with its respective stylesheet:

### Views

1. **Home**: The homepage with a brief introduction about me.
2. **About Me**: A more detailed section about my background and experience.
3. **Projects**: Displays the projects I have developed, featuring a carousel that allows users to navigate through them.
4. **Contact**: A contact section with a form for users to get in touch.

### Stylesheets

Each view has its own CSS stylesheet to maintain a clean and modular structure. I also included a general **CSS** file and a view for the **Layout** of the site.

### Project Carousel

In the "Projects" section, I implemented a carousel using JavaScript that allows users to scroll through different projects. This provides a more interactive experience, letting users click through projects to view more details.

## Technologies Used

- **Express**: Web server framework.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment on the server-side.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and design of the website.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactions, including the project carousel.
- **EmailJS**: Used to send the contact form data via email.
